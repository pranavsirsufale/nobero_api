# Django API with HTML Integration

This project is a mini implementation of a Django API integrated with an HTML frontend. The project demonstrates how to create a simple API using Django and connect it to an HTML page, where a button is provided to trigger the API call.

## Features

- **Django API**: A basic API built using Django.
- **HTML Frontend**: An HTML page with a button to send a request to the API.
- **Interactive Response**: The API response is displayed on the HTML page when the button is clicked.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/pranavsirsufale/nobero_api
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2. **Install the required packages:**

    Make sure you have Python and pip installed. Then, install the required packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the Django server:**

    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

4. **Access the application:**

    Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`. You'll see the HTML page with a button. Click the button to send a request to the Django API.

## Usage

- **API Call**: When you click the button on the HTML page, a request is sent to the Django API. The API processes the request and returns a response, which is then displayed on the HTML page.

## Future Enhancements

- Add more endpoints to the API for additional functionality.
- Improve the HTML frontend with CSS styling.
- Implement error handling and display appropriate messages in the UI.
